# Mod-10 Counter Verilog Design

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a Mod-10 counter using T Flip-Flops (TFFs). The project includes the design files, a testbench to verify the counter, simulation waveforms, and Vivado project files for easy integration.

## Project Structure

- **`sim/`**: Contains simulation output waveforms (PNG format) generated using Vivado, along with the associated `.wfcg` file.
- **`src/`**: Contains the Verilog source code files for the design.
  - `tff.v`: T-type flip-flop module.
  - `mod_10_counter.v`: Mod-10 counter design using T-type flip-flops.
- **`tb/`**: Contains the testbench for the Mod-10 counter.
  - `mod_10_counter_tb.v`: Verilog testbench for verifying the Mod-10 counter.
- **`vivado-project/`**: Vivado project files (`.xpr`) for easy integration and simulation.

## Modules

### `tff.v`

This module implements a T-type flip-flop. The T flip-flop toggles its output `Q` on each clock cycle when the `T` input is high. If `reset` is high, the output `Q` is reset to 0.

**Inputs:**
- `T`: T input to control toggling.
- `clk`: Clock input.
- `reset`: Reset input (active high).

**Output:**
- `Q`: The output of the flip-flop.

### `mod_10_counter.v`

This module implements a Mod-10 counter using four T-type flip-flops. The counter outputs a 4-bit value that counts from 0 to 9 in binary, then resets back to 0.

**Inputs:**
- `on`: Enable signal to turn the counter on or off.
- `clk`: Clock input.
- `reset`: Reset input (active high).

**Outputs:**
- `out[3:0]`: 4-bit output representing the current counter value.

### `mod_10_counter_tb.v`

This is the testbench for the `mod_10_counter`. It generates a clock signal and applies a reset to the counter while testing its functionality.

**Testbench Signals:**
- `on`: Controls whether the counter is enabled.
- `clk`: Clock signal to drive the counter.
- `reset`: Reset signal to initialize the counter.
- `count[3:0]`: 4-bit wire to capture the counter's output value.

## Simulation

1. The simulation files are located in the `sim/` folder and include the waveform files generated by Vivado.
2. To simulate the design, load the Vivado project in the `vivado-project/` folder and run the simulation to view the waveform.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Setup Vivado Project**:
   - Create a new project in Xilinx Vivado (name it `mod_10_counter`).
   - Add files in `src/` as design sources.
   - Add files in `tb/` as simulation sources.

2. **Simulate the Design**:
   - Run the simulation to observe the counter's behavior.
   - The generated waveform is available in the `sim/` folder as `sim.png`.
